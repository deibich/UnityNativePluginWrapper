# UnityNativePluginWrapper

When Unity has loaded a native plugin, it does not unload it anymore. This makes the development of native plugins for cumbersome. This wrapper enables the manual loading and unloading of a library/plugin in Unity before the engine does so.

The wrapper is intended for use in the Unity Editor on Windows
